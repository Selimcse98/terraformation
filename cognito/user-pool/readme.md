# Cognito User Pools
A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through 
Amazon Cognito. Your users can also sign in through social identity providers like Facebook or Amazon, and through SAML 
identity providers. Whether your users sign in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory
 profile that you can access through an SDK.

User pools provide:
- Sign-up and sign-in services.
- A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users.
- Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, and Login with Amazon, as well as sign-in with SAML identity providers from your user pool.
- User directory management and user profiles.
- Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and email verification.
- Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.
