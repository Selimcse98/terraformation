# bash
[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for 
the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been distributed 
widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS.

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. 
Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename 
globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for 
condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. 
Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.

The shell's name is an acronym for `Bourne-again` shell, a pun on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces and on 
the common term "born again".
