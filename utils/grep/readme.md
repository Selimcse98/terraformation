# grep
Grep (an acronym for “Global Regular Expression Print”) and is available on most linux systems. Grep finds a string in a 
given file or input, quickly and efficiently. While most everyday uses of the command are simple, there are a variety of 
more advanced uses that most people don’t know about — including regular expressions and more, which can become 
quite complicated.
