## Cross Cluster Search (ES)
The [Cross Cluster Search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-cross-cluster-search.html) feature allows any node to act as a federated client across multiple clusters. A cross cluster search node wonâ€™t join the remote cluster, instead it connects to a remote cluster in a light fashion in order to execute federated search requests.

Cross-cluster search requires [configuring remote clusters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-remote-clusters.html).

Note that cross cluster search uses the native elasticsearch binary transport protocol, so port 9300.

## Cross Cluster Search (Kibana)
Starting in [Kibana 6.3](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.2/management-cross-cluster-search.html), you can specify multiple clusters to search as a comma-separated list using the cluster_one:index_name,cluster_two:index_name notation.
